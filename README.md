# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
# Random Password Generator

This is my submission for the Week 3 challenge, where we were tasked with creating a random password generator using our Python knowledge from class.

## Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge was to develop a program that generates a random password based on certain criteria provided by the user. The password should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program should prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password, which should be between 8 and 128 characters.

## Solution

I approached the challenge by implementing the solution in JavaScript, which allowed me to create an interactive web-based password generator. Here's how the program works:

1. The program prompts the user to specify which criteria they want to include in their password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The user can select multiple criteria.

2. Next, the program asks the user to enter the desired length of the password. It validates the input to ensure it is a number between 8 and 128.

3. Using the selected criteria and the specified length, the program generates a random password by selecting random characters from the chosen character sets.

4. Finally, the generated password is displayed to the user in an HTML input field on the webpage.

## How to Use

To use the random password generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. The webpage will display a series of prompts asking you to select the criteria and enter the desired length of the password.

4. After providing the necessary input, click the "Generate" button.

5. The generated password will be displayed in the designated input field on the webpage.


I had a great time working on this challenge and expanding my Python knowledge.
